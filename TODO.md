# Peter Hook TODO

## Immediate Tasks

### Code Quality
- [ ] Fix remaining lint warnings (unused variables, dead code)
- [ ] Clean up rustfmt.toml to use stable features only
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling tests
- [ ] Improve test coverage for edge cases

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement hook result caching for repeated runs
- [ ] Add incremental execution (skip if files unchanged since last success)  
- [ ] Optimize parallel execution thread pool management
- [ ] Add timeout support for long-running hooks

### Enhanced Git Integration
- [ ] Auto-detect default branch for pre-push (not hardcoded "main")
- [ ] Support git worktrees and submodules more robustly
- [ ] Add support for git-lfs hooks
- [ ] Implement proper handling of git arguments for commit-msg hooks

## Feature Enhancements

### Configuration Improvements
- [ ] Add configuration inheritance (merge parent + child configs)
- [ ] Implement configuration validation warnings (e.g., missing commands)
- [ ] Add support for conditional hook execution based on environment
- [ ] Create configuration migration tools for breaking changes

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Add `peter-hook init` command to generate starter configurations
- [ ] Implement hook performance profiling and reporting
- [ ] Add dry-run mode that shows what would run without executing
- [ ] Create interactive configuration builder

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement hook result caching with cache invalidation
- [ ] Add support for hook timeouts and resource limits
- [ ] Create hook marketplace/registry for sharing configurations
- [ ] Implement hook composition (run hook A, modify its output, pass to hook B)

## Distribution & Ecosystem

### Package Management
- [ ] Create Homebrew formula
- [ ] Add Chocolatey package for Windows
- [ ] Submit to package managers (APT, YUM, etc.)
- [ ] Create Docker images for CI environments

### IDE Integration
- [ ] VS Code extension for hook management
- [ ] IntelliJ plugin for configuration editing
- [ ] Vim plugin for hook execution
- [ ] Language server protocol support for hooks.toml

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow templates
- [ ] GitLab CI template library
- [ ] Jenkins plugin
- [ ] Azure DevOps extension

## Documentation & Community

### Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive user guide with real-world examples
- [ ] Add API documentation for library usage
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add migration guide from other hook managers

### Community Building
- [ ] Set up issue templates and contributing guidelines
- [ ] Create example configurations for popular frameworks
- [ ] Write blog posts about monorepo hook patterns
- [ ] Create video tutorials and demos

## Technical Debt

### Code Organization
- [ ] Refactor large modules into smaller, focused modules
- [ ] Improve error message consistency and helpfulness
- [ ] Add more granular error types instead of generic anyhow errors
- [ ] Create traits for better testability and mocking

### Testing
- [ ] Add integration tests with real git repositories
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add chaos testing for parallel execution edge cases
- [ ] Test memory usage patterns for large monorepos

### Security
- [ ] Implement sandbox mode for untrusted hook execution
- [ ] Add signature verification for hook configurations
- [ ] Create security audit checklist
- [ ] Implement resource usage limits

## Future Considerations

### Advanced Architecture
- [ ] Plugin system for custom hook types
- [ ] Remote hook execution (hooks run on different machines)
- [ ] Distributed hook coordination for large teams
- [ ] Integration with build systems (Bazel, Buck, etc.)

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Hook execution metrics collection
- [ ] Performance dashboard and reporting
- [ ] Hook failure pattern analysis
- [ ] Team productivity metrics
