## Summary
- Imports: reusable hook libraries with local overrides, relative-only under repo root
- Validate: `--trace-imports` and `--json` diagnostics
- Changed files env vars: `CHANGED_FILES`, `CHANGED_FILES_LIST`, `CHANGED_FILES_FILE`

## Details
- Config imports merge in order; local overrides imported; cycles safely skipped
- Import security: only relative paths, and only within the repository root
- Validate diagnostics: show import order, overrides, cycles, unused imports; JSON option for tooling
- Env vars are pre-filtered per-hook based on its `files` patterns; temp file path provided for large lists and Windows

## Tests
- Parser: import merge/override, cycles, absolute/out-of-root rejections
- Executor: env var injection (filtered, unfiltered, empty) validated via command output
